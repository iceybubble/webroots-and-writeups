# 🌐 Webroots and Writeups

Welcome to my cybersecurity learning repository! This project documents my progress through various modules on [TryHackMe](https://tryhackme.com), with a focus on **web fundamentals**, **real-world examples**, and detailed **badge-based write-ups**.

## 🧭 What This Repo Is About

This repo is a personal journal of everything I’m learning — from how the web works under the hood, to practical hacking tools, HTTP analysis, and eventually, web application vulnerabilities.

Each write-up reflects:
- What I actually learned (not just task answers)
- Tools and commands I used
- Key takeaways from the badge or module
- How I’m applying this knowledge
